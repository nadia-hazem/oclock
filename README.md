## Project description

The goal of this project is to reproduce a timer, a stopwatch, an alarm clock, and a clock.
* It must be possible to increase the timer time using arrows, or to enter a “time” using an input. A button starts or stops the timer. When the timer reaches zero, an alert appears indicating that the time is up.
* For the stopwatch, you will have to start it and stop it with the same button (on / off). Additionally, you will need to implement a “lap” button, which will add the displayed time, at the moment the user presses, into a “time” list. A reset button will be present to reset the timer to 0.
* As for the clock, it must be in French time (UTC + 1), functional, and give the hour, the minutes, and the seconds.
* Finally for the alarm clock, the user can enter a time and a text in input. When the clock reaches the time entered, an alert (and not a popup) appears indicating the message that the user will have entered. In addition, the user will have the possibility to enter several alarms which will be displayed in a list, with “passed” if the time of the alarm has passed, and “in x time” with x representing the time remaining until the time is reached.
